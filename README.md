## Checkpoint landing page and signup form
The landing page is a simple website hosted on GitHub Pages with minimal config and no build process. You can clone or download this repo to use as a template for your own projects.

The signup form uses jQuery AJAX to send data to Mailchimp. If you want to use this form you'll need to [access your Mailchimp form code](https://mailchimp.com/help/host-your-own-signup-forms/). Next, in the form "action" attribute change  `post?u=` to `post-json?u=` and at the end of the url append `c=?`. You'll also need the `signup.js` script.
